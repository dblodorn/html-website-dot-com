# 📁  PUG / SASS / BABEL -> BROWSERIFY = HTML WEBSITE

Extremely basic gulp static site generator for instances when you only want html / css / javascript.
Of course you can add whatever you want on top... But really sometimes you just need to bust out some simple html (without going pure vanilla)!

+ PUG for the templates: src/pug
+ SASS for CSS pre-processing:  src/sass
+ Browserify / Babel for ES6 JS - Module imports & exports: src/js

## DATA:
-  JSON FILE for document variables located in src/_data
